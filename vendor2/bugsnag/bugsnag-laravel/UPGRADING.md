Upgrading
=========


## 1.x to 2.x

*Our library has gone through some major improvements. The primary change to watch out for is we're no longer overriding your exception handler.*

Since we're no longer overriding your exception handler, you'll need to restore your original handler, and then see our [new integration guide](http://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/php/laravel/) for how to bind our new logger to the container.

If you'd like access to all our new configuration, you'll need to re-publish our config file.
